## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

Personal Goals:
- Make it so that you can't submit if you don't enter a number.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM method
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I'm using forEach loops more and working refactoring my code more to make it as efficient as possible.  That's the fun part.


### Continued development

Just need to learn more Javascript!
